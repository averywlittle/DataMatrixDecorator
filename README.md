This project was a homework assignment in Java where we created a 2D data matrix which would process strings from a csv file.
We were tasked with using a decorator pattern to achieve this, and given an interface to implement. I ended up not using every
method I was given, and using a separate MatriFunction class to store all the relevant methods each extended function would use.
This was my attempt at following DRY principles within the scope of this project. I found programming to the decorator pattern to
produce easily readable code. In my studies, I found that the decorator shouldn't necessarily be something you program to, but more
so find a use for. If you end up programming a decorator and it only appears once, then it could be wasteful and become an anti-
pattern.
